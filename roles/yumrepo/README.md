yumrepo
=======

Role which helps to manage YUM repositories.


Examples
--------

This role can be used either from a playbook (section `roles`):

```
---

- hosts: myhost
  roles:
    - role: yumrepo
      yumrepo_repos:
        myrepo1:
          name: My repo 1
          baseurl: http://myserver
          gpgcheck: 0
        myrepo2:
          name: My repo 2
          baseurl: http://myserver
          gpgcheck: 0
```

Or in the meta file (section `dependencies`):

```

  platforms:
    - name: Debian
      versions:
        - all
    - name: EL
      versions:
        - all
  categories:

    yumrepo_repos:
      myrepo2:
        name: My repo 3
        baseurl: http://myserver
        gpgcheck: 0
```

The role also supports *managed mode* which removes any repo which is not managed
by this role.

```
---

# Example how to use the role in managed mode
- hosts: myhost
  vars:
    # This enables the managed mode
    yumrepo_manage: true

    # This prevents to delete CoreOS-Base repo file. Basically any repo file
    # which is not managed by the yumrepo role and is not listed in this variable
    # will be deleted.
    yumrepo_ignore_repo_files:
      - CentOS-Base
  roles:
    - role: yumrepo
      yumrepo_repos:
        myrepo4:
          name: My repo 4
          baseurl: http://myserver
    # When we finished with the setting of your YUM repos, we have to call the
    # role with the yumrepo_finish parameter to trigger the deletion of unmanaged
    # repos
    - role: yumrepo
      yumrepo_finish: true
```

If you are going to use the yumrepo across multiple plays in one playbook or in
multiple playbooks, I recomend to create a shared file where you write the
`yumrepo_manage` and the `yumrepo_ignore_repo_files` variables and then use it in
every play the `yumrepo` role is used.

```
---

# This is the content of the shared file (e.g. vars/yumrepo.yaml)

# Enable managed mode
yumrepo_manage: true

# Ignore these repos
yumrepo_ignore_repo_files:
  - CentOS-Base
```

```
---

# This is the playbook with multiple plays using the shared file

- hosts: ~host[1-5]
  vars:
    # This is our shared file
    vars/yumrepo.yaml
  roles:
    - role: yumrepo
      yumrepo_repos:
        myrepo1:
          name: My repo 1
          baseurl: http://myserver
    - approle1

- hosts: ~host[3-5]
  vars:
    # This is our shared file
    vars/yumrepo.yaml
  roles:
    - role: yumrepo
      yumrepo_repos:
        myrepo1:
          name: My repo 2
          baseurl: http://myserver
    - approle2

# We can place the yum_finish into a separate play at the end of the playbook
- hosts: all
  vars:
    # This is our shared file
    vars/yumrepo.yaml
  roles:
    - role: yumrepo
      yumrepo_finish: true
```

The managed mode uses the `/etc/yum.repos.d/.managed` file which is generated by
the role when the `yumrepo_finish` variable is set to `true`. This allows to
create YUM repos across multiple roles and once all is done, it will generate the
`.managed` file and clean the unmanaged repos.


Role variables
--------------

List of variables used by the role:

```
---

# If set to true, the management mode is enabled. That means that all unmanaged
# repos will be deleted). The best is to set it somewhere in a gobal variable
# file shared in all plays of the playbook.
yumrepo_manage: false

# Repository configuration
yumrepo_repos: []
# Example
#yumrepo_repos:
#  # ID of the repository
#  test:
#    # Additional parameters
#    name: Testing repo
#    baseurl: http://myserver/
#    enabled: 1
#    gpgcheck: 0
#    metadata_expire: 1

# Default list of repos files which won't be deleted during the clearing process
yumrepo_ignore_repos: []
# Example:
#yumrepo_ignore_repos:
#  - CentOS-Base

# To cleanup the temp directory and generate the .managed file
yumrepo_finish: false
```
